# action-test

This is a cool github action test with utilization of ChatGPT into the github action.

This can be a perfect repo moderation team member if utilized properly (unlike in this repo).

Try making a github issue and wait for 10 seconds before Dr House arrives out of nowhere for your differential diagnosis.

This is only for test purpose
